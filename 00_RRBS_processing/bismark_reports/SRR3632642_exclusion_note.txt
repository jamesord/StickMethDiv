It was noted in Artemov et al 2017 that one sample was excluded due to a low bisulfite conversion rate.
SRR3632642 is likely to be this rejected sample given the very high proportions of methylated cytosines in non-CpG contexts (~17% compared to ~0.4% in other samples)
According to Felix Krueger (Bismark dev), high % of non-CpG methylation can be an indicator of poor BS conversion: https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/issues/225
We could confirm by aligning the sample to the lambda phage genome as spiked-in phage DNA is included in the samples.
The phage DNA is used because the genome in completely unmethylated, so theoretically all cytosines should have been converted to thymines if the BS conversion was 100%
