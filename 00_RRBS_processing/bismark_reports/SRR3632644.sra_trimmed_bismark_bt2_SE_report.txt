Bismark report for: ../trimmed/SRR3632644.sra_trimmed.fq.gz (version: v0.22.3)
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /storage/workspaces/vetsuisse_fiwi_epev/fiwi_epev001/datasets/dataset_collection/stickleback/reference_genome/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	9118882
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	6086967
Mapping efficiency:	66.8%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	2004986
Sequences did not map uniquely:	1026929
