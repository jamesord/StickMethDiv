Bismark report for: ../trimmed/SRR3632633.sra_trimmed.fq.gz (version: v0.22.3)
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /storage/workspaces/vetsuisse_fiwi_epev/fiwi_epev001/datasets/dataset_collection/stickleback/reference_genome/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	17171256
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	11875181
Mapping efficiency:	69.2%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	3602096
Sequences did not map uniquely:	1693979
Sequences which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	1

Number of sequences with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/CT:	5937009	((converted) top strand)
CT/GA:	5938171	((converted) bottom strand)
GA/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
